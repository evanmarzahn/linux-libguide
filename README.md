# linux-libguide
A "libguide" created for LIS 635, based on the kinds of resources I wished I had when I started learning Linux to learn about operating systems in my free time and in undergraduate computer science courses.

## Using the Command Line
**ExplainShell ([www.explainshell.com](https://www.explainshell.org))**  
Search for commands--even complicated, multi-part ones--and this tool will parse the command and pull information from relevant manual pages to explain what each part of the command is doing. This is particularly helpful when general search engines (such as Google) ignore or misinterpret symbols and words (such as "-") that are often used in command line syntax.

## Troubleshooting and Asking for Help
Sometimes you want to do something you haven't yet learned how to do; sometimes you try to do something and it doesn't work as planned or causes a problem. In either case, searching for a solution from someone else who had the same need, or asking for help yourself, can be great options.  

**["How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric S. Raymond** is a classic and detailed essay about searching and asking questions that reflects and informs computing communities' approach to providing support. However, it is not written sympathetically.

Whenever you get information from strangers or unknown web sources, you should double-check the information you are given. For example, if someone gives you a set of instructions to run on the command line, first run them through [ExplainShell](https://www.explainshell.com) to make sure it does what the person claims it will. Similarly, never download or execute a file that you aren't familiar with.

### Searching the Web
Using a web search (via DuckDuckGo, Google, or whatever your preferred search engine is) is a good way to get information about strange problems or recent updates.  
Tips for effectively searching for tech support information:
* Try including "[name of software or hardware] documentation" to find  official help manuals and wikis
* The exact text of any error message, or at least the error code if there is one
* If there are too many results, narrow them down by including version numbers for the distribution or software you're using, or by using the search engine settings to filter to recent results.
* Phrase your query as a question ("how do I..." or "why does...") to return more results of people working through the same issue on a forum.  

### Using Forums and Mailing Lists

Where to find a place to ask for help:
* The website for the Linux distribution or particular piece of software you are using may have a forum or mailing list.
* **[StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/)** is a network of question-and-answer sites suitable as a general forum for questions. Many are devoted to computers: [Unix & Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/), [SuperUser](https://superuser.com/) for general computing; [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for programming. Among the [list of all StackExchange sites](https://stackexchange.com/sites#) there are also several devoted to popular Linux distributions or pieces of software that run on Linux.

To successfully ask for help on a forum or mailing list:
- Find a good place to post, as focused on whatever your topic is as possible. For example, check the 

## General Information
**ArchLinux Wiki ([wiki.archlinux.org](https://wiki.archlinux.org))**  
Created by and for users of the Arch distribution of Linux specifically, this wiki is widely recognized and used by many Linux users for detailed information on the operating system and much available software.

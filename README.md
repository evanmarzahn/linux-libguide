# linux-libguide
A collection of links to comprehensive information for learning Linux, suitable for serious, even if just beginning, learners (e.g. students working with Linux for operating system-focused computer science courses). Many, but not all, are freely available.

## General Information
**[Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)**  
A comprehensive set of beginner-friendly tutorials covering using and understanding a variety of aspects of Linux.

**[_How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Needs to Know_](https://www.amazon.com/How-Linux-Works-2nd-Superuser/dp/1593275676) by Brian Ward**  
A readable guide to how Linux works and how it is structured--the steps of the boot process, how drivers and devices work with the kernel, and so on.

**[_Linux Bible_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Linux+Bible,+10th+Edition-p-9781119578888) by Christopher Negus**  
A hands-on guide to using Linux that covers information applicable to total beginners all the way through advanced, system-administrator level topics. (Yes, it's very long.)

**[UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Nemeth-UNIX-and-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook-5th-Edition/PGM143215.html?tab=contents) by Evi Nemeth et al.**  
A definitive guide to almost every aspect of setting up and maintaining any Linux system. This is a book to use for reference, not suitable as a detailed tutorial.

**ArchLinux Wiki ([wiki.archlinux.org](https://wiki.archlinux.org))**  
Created by and for users of the Arch distribution of Linux specifically, this wiki is widely used by many enthusiast Linux users for detailed, up-to-date information on the operating system and much available software.

**[Free Programming Books: Linux](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books.md#linux) from EBookFoundation**  
A collection of links to freely-available e-books about Linux (part of a larger collection covering _many_ computing and programming topics). Many of these books are more specialized than the ones highlighted in this guide, and include further resources/bibliographies of their own, making this a good place to look for more specialized information.

## Using the Command Line
**[_The Linux Command Line_](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) by William Shotts**  
Updated every few years and available for free as a PDF or for purchase in print, this book is detailed and includes a lot of advanced information, but starts with the basics and doesn't require much previous experience with the command line or Linux.

**ExplainShell ([www.explainshell.com](https://www.explainshell.org))**  
Search for commands--even complicated, multi-part ones--and this tool will parse the command and pull information from relevant manual pages to explain what each part of the command is doing. This is particularly helpful when general search engines (such as Google) ignore or misinterpret symbols and words (such as "-") that are often used in command line syntax.

**ShellCheck ([www.shellcheck.net/](https://www.shellcheck.net/))**  
This tool will check for errors in any shell (command line) script you paste into it. Can serve a similar purpose as ExplainShell in preventing you from accidentally messing up your system by running weird commands.

**[_Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide: an in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting_](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html) by Mendel Cooper**  
A detailed, beginner-to-advanced tutorial on shell (command line) script-writing that assumes no previous scripting or programming knowledge. 

## Troubleshooting and Asking for Help
**["How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric S. Raymond** is a classic and detailed essay about searching and asking questions that reflects and informs computing communities' approach to providing support. However, it is not written sympathetically.

Whenever you get information from strangers or unknown web sources, you should double-check the information you are given. For example, if someone gives you a set of instructions to run on the command line, first run them through [ExplainShell](https://www.explainshell.com) to make sure it does what the person claims it will. Similarly, never download or execute a file that you aren't familiar with.

### Searching the Web
Using a web search (via DuckDuckGo, Google, or whatever your preferred search engine is) is a good way to get information about strange problems or recent updates.  
Tips for effectively searching for tech support information:
* Try including "[name of software or hardware] documentation" to find  official help manuals and wikis
* The exact text of any error message, or at least the error code if there is one
* If there are too many results, narrow them down by including version numbers for the distribution or software you're using, or by using the search engine settings to filter to recent results.
* Phrase your query as a question ("how do I..." or "why does...") to return more results of people working through the same issue on a forum.  

### Using Forums and Mailing Lists

Where to find a place to ask for help:
* The website or other community page for the Linux distribution or particular piece of software you are using likely has a forum or mailing list, or maybe even a chat via IRC or Discord.
* **[StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/)** is a network of question-and-answer sites suitable as a general forum for questions. Many are devoted to computers: [Unix & Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/), [SuperUser](https://superuser.com/) for general computing; [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for programming. Among the [list of all StackExchange sites](https://stackexchange.com/sites#) there are also several devoted to popular Linux distributions or pieces of software that run on Linux.
* **Reddit** has subreddits devoted to Linux, including many specialized topics, distributions, and pieces of software. The **[/r/linux4noobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/)** community accepts a range of Linux questions, and refers to many other relevant subreddits.
